But, as someone interested in selling to them, I would never do that again. I brought in a huge selection of books I was interested in selling and they only took 4 of the books and offered me a few measely dollars. I was shocked. I understand they need to make a profit but I wasn't even getting $1 for each book they wanted. A total rip off if you ask me and a waste of time waiting for them to look through my stuff.
